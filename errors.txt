[rejected] main -> main (fetch first) error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/shyamsandeep907/azure-vm-defender-signature-update.git' hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use hint: 'git pull' before pushing again. hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

resolution:
Your remote main branch already has at least one commit (probably the README created on GitHub), and your local main has a different history.

Git is protecting you from overwriting it.

✅ Correct & Clean Fix (Recommended)

Run this:

git pull origin main --rebase

If it succeeds, then run:

git push origin main

That’s it.

🔎 What --rebase Does (Why We Use It)

Instead of creating a messy merge commit, it:

Downloads the remote commit

Replays your local commits on top of it

Keeps history clean

This is the professional workflow ✔️
